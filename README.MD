This Git Repository includes a gitignore file and a Jupyter notebook containing the details of my description and demonstration of aspects of the numpy-random package.

To work with a Jupyter Notebook file in GitHub, see advise notes at https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/working-with-jupyter-notebook-files-on-github

To run the Jupyter file on my local computer, open the command line interface and type in "jupyter notebook".

 To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
